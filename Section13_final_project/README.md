# PART 1: DATA PREP
**Email from Ski Shop Manager**

Our Excel expert has been skiing for 3 months now, and we really need to analyze our Black Friday sales data!

In the Excel workbook attached, you'll see that we're missing data for taxes and totals. Can you fill in those rows of data using Python?

You'll find more detailed instructions in the notebook attached, and I'll follow up shortly with more steps for the analysis.

**Key Objectives**: 
1. Read in data from an Excel workbook
2. Define a function that prints cell contents
3. Create a dictionary using a comprehension and string methods
4. Use for loops to manipulate Excel data
5. Import and call a previously saved function
6. Write data into Excel cells
7. Save an Excel workbook
